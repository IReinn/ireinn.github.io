<h2>WHAT <em>IS STEAM?</em></h2><img src="/web/20040615053641im_/http://steampowered.com/img/Graphic_box.jpg" height="6" width="24" alt=""><br>
Steam is Valve's new way of getting games into your hands ASAP. Games like Half-Life, Counter-Strike, and Counter-Strike: Condition Zero are all being made available through Steam.<br>
<br>
Steam games are automatically kept up-to-date with the latest content and revisions. Steam also includes an instant-message client which even works while you're in-game.<br>
<br>
<!--
At its core, Steam is a distributed file system and shared set of technology components that can be implemented into any software application.<br>
<br>
With Steam, developers are given integrated tools for direct-content publishing, flexible billing, ensured-version control, anti-cheating, anti-piracy, and more.<br>
